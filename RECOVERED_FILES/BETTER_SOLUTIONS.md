# Better Solutions Than Custom Server

**Date**: September 30, 2025  
**Issue**: Our custom server isn't conversational, lacks context, and we're reinventing the wheel

---

## 🚨 STOP REINVENTING THE WHEEL!

You're absolutely right - there are **production-ready solutions** that handle:
- ✅ Conversational context
- ✅ Chat history
- ✅ Better output streaming
- ✅ OpenAI-compatible APIs
- ✅ Professional UI

---

## 🎯 Top 3 Recommended Solutions

### **Option 1: LM Studio CLI Mode** ⭐ **EASIEST**

**What it is:** LM Studio has a headless server mode!

**Pros:**
- ✅ You already know the interface
- ✅ Conversational by default
- ✅ CLI mode: `lms server start`
- ✅ OpenAI-compatible API
- ✅ Professional, tested, reliable

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ Requires GGUF models (not standard transformers)
- ⚠️ May need desktop install first

**Setup on HPC:**
```bash
# Download LM Studio CLI
# Then start server
lms server start --port 8080

# Load model on demand (JIT loading)
lms model load --name <model_name>
```

**Compatibility:** Works with GGUF models from HuggingFace

### **Option 2: vLLM** ⭐⭐ **BEST PERFORMANCE**

**What it is:** Industry-standard, high-performance LLM serving

**Pros:**
- ✅ **MUCH faster** than transformers
- ✅ Conversational context built-in
- ✅ OpenAI-compatible API
- ✅ Used by major companies
- ✅ Works with standard HuggingFace models (no GGUF needed!)
- ✅ Better memory management
- ✅ Continuous batching

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ Slightly more complex setup

**Setup on HPC:**
```bash
pip install vllm

# Start server with conversational mode
python -m vllm.entrypoints.openai.api_server \
    --model Qwen/Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct \
    --port 8080 \
    --host 0.0.0.0
```

**Why it's better:**
- 2-5x faster inference
- Handles conversation context automatically
- Streaming responses
- Production-grade

cd text-generation-webui
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Start server
python server.py --model Qwen/Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct --listen --api
```

**Features:**
- Chat mode with history
- Instruct mode
- Notebook mode
